Description:

This program reads in the coordinates given based on the amount of N (to make the size of the
matrix), then builds a 2*N x 8 matrix and a 2*N x 1 vector and then uses ATA and ATb
in order to make an 8 x 8 matrix that sends to LUdecompose and then LUsolve to solve for
and output the homography matrix in row-major order.

How to compile and run:

make
./homography < boxtop.in (And any other text file you want to use)
./homography < shelves.in (Works as well)
./homography < boxtop.in | ./hmap cheerios-small.ppm 500 650 > face.ppm (This will work too)

List of files:

(cheerios-small.ppm not included due to file uploading size restraints)
